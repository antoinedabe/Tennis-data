## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Single-page application**: Built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (no frameworks)
- **Responsive design**: Uses flexbox for centering and viewport meta tag for mobile compatibility
- **Modern CSS approach**: Leverages CSS3 features including gradients, box-shadows, and transitions
- **Component-based styling**: Button is styled as a reusable component with hover states

### Styling Strategy
- **CSS Reset**: Implements universal reset to ensure consistent rendering across browsers
- **Design system**: Uses system fonts and a cohesive color palette
- **Visual hierarchy**: Gradient background with elevated button using shadows and typography
- **Interactive feedback**: Hover effects and transitions for better user experience

### File Structure
- **Minimal structure**: Single HTML file containing embedded CSS (inline styles in `<style>` tag)
- **Self-contained**: No external dependencies or build process required
- **Browser-ready**: Can be opened directly in any modern web browser

## External Dependencies

### Core Technologies
- **HTML5**: Standard markup language for structure
- **CSS3**: For styling, animations, and responsive design
- **System fonts**: Uses native font stack (-apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, etc.)

### Browser Requirements
- **Modern browser support**: Requires browsers with CSS3 support for gradients and flexbox
- **No external libraries**: Pure vanilla web technologies with no third-party dependencies
- **No build tools**: Direct browser execution without compilation or bundling
